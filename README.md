## TODO Tags

- `TODO(optimization)` - can be implemented faster, just haven't gotten around to yet
- `TODO(slow)` - it's slower than I think it can/should be, but not sure how
- `TODO(deprecated)` - this needs to be removed
- `TODO(testing)` - this thing needs to be verified with test cases
- `TODO(cleanup)` - this can be less lines of code
- `TODO(gross)` - this is terrible
- `TODO(bug)` - this is a known bug
- `TODO(feature)` - a thing can be added here to improve things

## Client Server Handshake

1. Server is initialized in empty state
2. Server is told to load a [MessageKind::LoadSave]
3. Server loads the save and notifies clients
   of success with [MessageKind::HasNewSave], or failure with [MessageKind::ServerError]
4. Probably nobody will be connected at this point
5. On connection, server sends the client [MessageKind::WhoGoesThere].
5. Client responds with a [MessageKind::Introduction] containing their username
6. If the server accepts their connection, responds with [MessageKind::Welcome] or
   with [MessageKind::ServerError] on error
7. When client gets [MessageKind::Welcome], will send server [MessageKind::BeginAsyncWorldDownload]
